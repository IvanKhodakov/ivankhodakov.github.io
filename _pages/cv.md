Portfolio
======

* Research project on StyleGAN2, June 2024
  * Editing of face images by manipulating latent codes. To exhibit semantics I used PCA and SVMs.
* Skin Lesion Classification - ISIC dataset, April 2024
  * Scored among the best in a Kaggle competition. The aim was to classify skin lesions into 9 classes. Tools Used: CNN, Resnet50, Pytorch, Data Augmentation, Feature Extraction.
* Other Projects, 2023
  * Predict the outcome of a football match : Cleaning data, feature engineering. Tools Used : XGBoost, Weights and Biases.
  * Detection JPEG compression and forgeries in Python in image using algorithms like the DCT of the images.
  * Creation of a mobile recipe application with carbon footprint computation.
